  Forest Apps is a collection of practical software tools and numerical utilities developed for naval architects, ocean engineers, and offshore engineers. 
  The site focuses on engineering-oriented workflows, efficient modelling, and reproducible analysis, supporting both preliminary design and research activities in marine and offshore engineering.

  <br/>
  
  We provide lightweight, engineer-friendly applications covering key analysis tasks commonly encountered in floating offshore structures, marine renewable energy, and ship & offshore system design.The tools are designed to complement commercial software by offering open, inspectable, and extensible implementations suitable for education, research, and early-stage engineering studies.
