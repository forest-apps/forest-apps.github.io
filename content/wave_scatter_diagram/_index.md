Wave Scatter Diagram Tool enables the generation of site-specific wave scatter diagrams worldwide in accordance with DNVGL-RP-C205, supporting offshore structure and mooring design for both Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and Fatigue Limit State (FLS) assessments. It applies the Conditional Modelling Approach (CMA) joint environmental model recommended by DNV, allowing designers to estimate sea state occurrence probabilities in the absence of detailed metocean reports. The tool supports nautical zone–based scatter diagrams using Weibull and Log-Normal distribution parameters for significant wave height (HS) and zero-crossing period (TZ), as well as joint environmental models for North Atlantic and worldwide ship operations. Users can customize bin widths and midpoints, export scatter data to text or Excel formats, and save publication-ready figures for direct inclusion in technical reports.
