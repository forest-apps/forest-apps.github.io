## 🧮 Analysis Functions

### Feasibility Calculation
Determine whether a valid thrust allocation solution exists for a given environmental condition while minimizing total power consumption.

### DP Capability Analysis
Assess the **maximum environmental loads** a vessel can withstand while maintaining station-keeping, supporting DP capability plots and operability assessments.

---

## ⚙️ DP System & Thruster Modeling

### Comprehensive Thruster Configuration
Model a wide range of thruster types, including:
- Azimuth thrusters  
- Tunnel thrusters  
- Shaft propellers  

Each thruster can be configured with position, orientation, power limits, and operational constraints.

### Robust Thrust Allocation
Apply robust thrust allocation algorithms to realistically distribute thrust forces and moments while respecting physical and operational limitations.

---

## 🌊 Environmental Load Modeling

### Multi-Source Environmental Loads
Accurately model external forces acting on the vessel, including:
- Wind loads  
- Wave loads  
- Current loads  

These loads form the basis for both feasibility and capability calculations.

---

## ⚠️ Failure & Scenario Analysis

### Failure Mode Definition
Simulate DP system performance under defined failure conditions, such as:
- Thruster failures  
- Power loss scenarios  
- Forbidden zones and thrust limitations  

This supports intact and failure case evaluations in accordance with DP practice.
